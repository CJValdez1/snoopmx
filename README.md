## 🌎 Mission

I’m motivated by Ethereum’s potential to promote **digital sovereignty**, **education as a public good**, and a **decentralized future built by and for Latin America**.

My goal is to empower Latin American students to become active participants in the Ethereum ecosystem—not just users, but **builders and developers**.
