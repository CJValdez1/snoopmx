# ![]() My name is CJValdez, and I’m a SoloHomeStaker, educator, cypherpunk and builder deeply committed to the Ethereum ecosystem since 2017. I’m the Founder of Ethereum Veracruz, a community that bridges academia and Web3, and I serve as Community Lead at Stakers Union and Delegate at Obol Collective. I’m also a full-time Educator at Universidad Veracruzana (uv.mx), where I’ve taught emerging technologies for over 14 years, integrating Ethereum and blockchain into formal education since 2019.

In 2022, I became the first and only SoloHomeStaker in Mexico, launching and maintaining a solo validator node on Ethereum Mainnet. Through this initiative, I champion decentralization, security, and privacy, promoting home staking practices across Latin America. I actively contribute to communities like ETHStaker, CoinCashew, Rancho Stake, Cypherpunk Citadel DAO, and I’m also a builder at BuidlGuidl.

Ethereum Veracruz was born from a growing student interest in blockchain. Since 2020, over 300 students from our Information Technologies in Organizations degree program have taken mandatory courses in Blockchain, DeFi, and Web3. In 2024, we organized the regional onboarding event, participated in ETHGlobal, Ethereum México, and DEVCON7, and were recognized as one of the most impactful blockchain communities in Mexico in the first year.

I’m motivated by Ethereum’s potential to promote digital sovereignty, education as a public good, and a decentralized future built by and for Latin America. My goal is to empower Latin American students to become active participants in the Ethereum ecosystem—not just users, but builders and developers of it.
